<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>My name is Tim Osborne, student number s3860099 and you can contact me at <a href="mailto:s3860099@student.rmit.edu.au">s3860099@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. I&rsquo;m a second generation Australian born in Melbourne and have lived in the state of Victoria for all of my life. Being from here I speak a pretty poor imitation of English and I did Italian and French in highschool though I remember very little of it, I also know a tiny bit of German from my grandma. I&rsquo;m an avid reader of high fantasy and alt history fiction and I recently took up cooking because it&rsquo;s a lot like one of my favourite subjects in highschool, chemistry, with two differences. I&rsquo;m actually good at it and I can eat what I end up with. Of course my favourite subject was IT because I had been using computers pretty much since I was able to. At a young age I saw family around me start to pick up technology, mostly computers and I thought it was so cool because there were all these fun games to play where you could colour things in, draw and there were point and click adventure games that blew my little mind. Since then I&rsquo;ve always been around computers including the three years of IT I took in highschool one of which was doing the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; class in year 11. Up until now where I&rsquo;m using OUA to go to RMIT which I chose because it was the closest to what I wanted while also having the most detail about what I could expect before, after and during. I hope at the end of this course I can understand not just computers but also the software on them and how they run and how they can break and be fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <a title="Personality Test Results" href="https://daftvaderdev.github.io/Images/Personality%20type.PNG">Personality test</a> I found that a lot of it doesn&rsquo;t apply to me at all but there are a few things that ring true, the <a title="Learning Style Results" href="https://daftvaderdev.github.io/Images/Learning%20Style.png">learning style</a> test is definitely true for me in how I learn best and the <a title="Emotional Intelligence Results" href="https://daftvaderdev.github.io/Images/Emotional&20Intelligence.PNG">emotional intelligence</a> test shows I can at least more often than not tell what somebody is feeling.Overall I think i&rsquo;ll help my performance on a team since I&rsquo;m supposedly a good listener and work pretty well with others and in turn can tell if they&rsquo;re upset. I think I&rsquo;ll perform best with people who tend to take charge of groups effectively and have a clear plan of what they want to do and in turn I can help keep team members from butting heads and from feeling left out.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ideal Job</strong></p>
<p>My ideal job would be as this <a title="SEEK Page" href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41185003?type=standard#searchRequestToken=10ee6342-5ee0-442a-93de-4e229b2817fe">IT manager</a> since they are for a timber plantation company and I&rsquo;m very sensitive to the use of wood for carpentry and construction ever since I did woodwork in highschool and taught about the severity of deforestation. I would be in charge of a small group of 3-8 people and would be implementing IT solutions to help the business achieve its goals. It needs skill related to management and technical skills involving networks, security and support for currently in place IT systems. They also expect an experienced leader who can effectively handle the team working beneath them to efficiently carry out the tasks they have been given. Currently I have a little experience as a leader through school programs and a little overseeing other contractors as well as some experience dealing with general computer troubleshooting and have enough knowledge to be able to research potential solutions to the problems as long as they&rsquo;re related to general issues. I think the best way to build upon my current skill set is through direct experience so I would aim for jobs that I could use as stepping stones such as those related to networks, security and hopefully those with leadership roles that would allow me to build up to managing other IT workers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Project Idea</strong></p>
<p><em>Overview</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always valued privacy ever since I learned how easy it was to be removed with technology, as such my project will be a collection of security programs and will serve as a secure hub of sorts containing a VPN, a password manager, an anti-virus, a secure web browser and a secure cloud based encrypted file storage. These will all be accessible through one program i.e. the hub but won&rsquo;t necessarily all be able to run in said program window and may open as a separate window. It will also allow account management so that you can manage your cloud storage, payment and personal information.</p>
<p><em>Motivation</em></p>
<p>In a world that is rapidly evolving with technology becoming more and more integrated into people&rsquo;s lives, it is becoming quickly apparent that the lines drawn decades ago about an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy are eroding. In response to data becoming much more valuable to companies that can profit from it, most of the population&rsquo;s willingness to give it to them in the form of social media privacy and governments using technology to allow them to spy on their citizens it&rsquo;s become apparent that people have to take their privacy into their own hands.</p>
<p><em>Description</em></p>
<p>To begin with I&rsquo;m going to talk about account management. Right off the bat it might seem counter-intuitive to want a secure service to protect your privacy only to give it away to the person saying they can give you your privacy back but the account is only for 2 things. First it&rsquo;s there to identify you not personally only by email or username so that if you need to install it onto a new computer since the base program will be a one time purchase and will include everything but the cloud file storage however will have the structures to allow those competent to set up a local secure server and the expanded VPN servers that are more likely to get around a government or companies attempts to stop proxy&rsquo;s. The reason for this is because servers for both proxies and file storage can get expensive very quickly and without constant cash flow from those that wish to use them the service would quickly sink. The password manager would be local or cloud based with no extra charge but a simple storage limit given that for the most part most people would only need a max of ~15 passwords and since they are simple text they won&rsquo;t take up much space and given that it's a choice not all will be comfortable having their passwords stored elsewhere. It will also have the ability to generate unique passwords itself that are made of random text made locally so that there is no worry about interception in any way. The VPN or Virtual Private Network functions as a proxy allowing you to essentially trick websites into thinking you&rsquo;re somewhere else which allows you to either get access to content you couldn&rsquo;t otherwise or stop your internet provider or someone intercepting your traffic from being able to see exactly what you do. The base version will include access to a few VPN servers in most countries that have modern internet infrastructure allowing access to content in other countries however being limited to a few servers means that it isn&rsquo;t too hard to be blocked by governments or companies. The subscription model will give access to constantly updated servers in an effort to avoid being blocked and allowing all content to be accessed and watched. The anti-virus will function like other market leaders providing from files or programs hidden in websites, emails or downloads that are likely to harm your computer. The base program will have the ability to scan your computer and quarantine and delete flagged items that it detects while the paid version will let you protect up to 5 computers with real-time flagging of spam or websites that are likely to contain malware as well as parental controls that will allow parents to easily set active hours for all apps or services such as internet as well as restrict some completely. It will also allow you to encrypt folders and work with the password manager to make sure that only you and those you want to share access to are able to get into these folders.</p>
<p><em>Tools and Technologies</em></p>
<p>To start with this program is going to need quite a lot of servers. Proxy servers in most countries as well as storage servers to allow people to have their cloud encrypted storage as well as password storage. They have to be reliable and fast servers otherwise they will grow dissatisfied with the software and abandon it since most people leave a site if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. The software required will be fairly extensive including a password manager which can easily found open source, a VPN can be found open source but given what&rsquo;s required making one is probably more effective, anti-virus can be found open-source and likely expanded to make what&rsquo;s required, integrating Brave would be easiest since its a nice open source browser that runs well and building a secure file storage system for both the service itself and the password storage.</p>
<p><em>Skills Required</em></p>
<p>As mentioned above, fast servers will be required for both the VPN tunnels as well as the file storage because no one will want to use a slow VPN given the amount of options available and secure cloud storage is pointless if just putting the files on a portable hard-drive or USB is faster. Since a lot of the software used is open-source most of the work is done it just requires them to be integrated with each other which is why it&rsquo;s likely best to build the VPN and file storage in house to make it easier to integrate password storage and make sure the VPN works as intended and given how prevalent most of these services are skills and hardware should be easy and relatively cheap to come by.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Outcome</em></p>
<p>With any luck the program will launch and the launch day bugs will get quickly fixed allowing people to have a centralised hub of security services and software that will allow them to not only better protect their personal lives but also better access the world around them without fear of tracking or regional locking. Though if this program were to somehow become big enough or widespread it may only make the people who oppose it such as advertisement companies and governments which seek to control what their citizens see double down on their efforts to suppress or nullify the software.</p>
